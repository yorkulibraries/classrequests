# Start developing

```
git clone https://github.com/yorkulibraries/classrequests.git
cd classrequests
docker compose up --build
```

There are 3 containers created: **web**, **db** and **mailcatcher**

# Access the front end web app

By default, the application will listen on port 3009 and runs with RAILS_ENV=development.

To access the application in Chrome browser, you will need to add the ModHeader extension to your Chrome browser.

Header: PYORK_USER
Value: admin (or manager or whatever user you want to mimic)

For convenience, you can import the ModHeader profile from the included ModHeader_admin.json. 

Now you can login as if you have been authenticated by PY.

http://localhost:3009/users/ppy_login


# Access mailcatcher web app

http://localhost:3089/

# What if I want to use a different port?

If you wish to use a different port, you can set the PORT environment or change PORT in .env file.

```
PORT=4005 docker compose up --build
```

# Run tests

Start the containers if you haven't started them yet.

```
docker compose up --build
```

Run all the tests

```
docker compose exec web rt 
```

Run system tests

```
docker compose exec web rts
```

Run a specific test
```
docker compose exec web rt TEST=test/controllers/users_controller_test.rb
```

# Access chrome-server

You can access the chrome-server to see the system tests while they are running. The password is: **secret**
